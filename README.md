Language used: Python(for bm25 and tf-idf) and Java(only for Lucene) <br />
* To crawl data, Beautiful Soup library is used.
* Using two Retrieval Models (BM-25 Retrieval Model and tf-idf Retrieval Model), created a search engine which uses crawled data and generate index to search a given query.
* Compared the results of both models and generated a report.
* Report consists of working of two systems and the results obtained from them.It has _**query-by-query**_ analysis of the results obtained from both IR Systems.
